# Zigbee with light and AHT20 sensor

The ESP Zigbee SDK provides more examples and tools for productization:
* [ESP Zigbee SDK Docs](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-zigbee-sdk)
* [ESP Zigbee SDK Repo](https://github.com/espressif/esp-zigbee-sdk)

## Hardware Required

* One development board with ESP32-H2 or C6 SoC acting as Zigbee end-device
* A USB cable for power supply and programming

## Configure the project

Before project configuration and build, make sure to set the correct chip target using `idf.py --preview set-target TARGET` command.

## Erase the NVRAM

Before flash it to the board, it is recommended to erase NVRAM if user doesn't want to keep the previous examples or other projects stored info using `idf.py -p PORT erase-flash`

## Build and Flash

Build the project, flash it to the board, and start the monitor tool to view the serial output by running `idf.py -p PORT flash monitor`.

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)
